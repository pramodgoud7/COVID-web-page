                  The vaccines must be proven safe and effective in large (phase
                  III) clinical trials. Some COVID-19 vaccine candidates have
                  completed their phase III trials, and many other potential
                  vaccines are being developed.
                  <br />
                  Independent reviews of the efficacy and safety evidence is
                  required for each vaccine candidate, including regulatory
                  review and approval in the country where the vaccine is
                  manufactured, before WHO considers a vaccine candidate for
                  prequalification.

                  The vaccines must be manufactured in large quantities, which
                  is a major and unprecedented challenge â€“ all the while
                  continuing to produce all the other important life-saving
                  vaccines already in use.
                  <br />
                  As a final step, all approved vaccines will require
                  distribution through a complex logistical process, with
                  rigorous stock management and temperature control.

                  Officials in individual countries decide whether to approve
                  the vaccines for national use and develop policies for how to
                  use the vaccines in their country based on the WHO
                  recommendations.
